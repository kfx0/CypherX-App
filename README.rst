CypherX

A python application base on `CypherX Python`_ which is a RSA (1024 bit) key generator, encryption and
decryption simple code. This application can code any size of message and decode it with a 
generated or entered RSA key.

=======

Code button will code a message with public key and Decode button will decode it with private
key. To use it as a message securing system, send your public key to anyone you want and save
private key in your notepad (or any other place). **Keep your private key safe**.

=======

To send a secure message, code it with your friend public key and to decode a recieved message
decode it with your private key. When you send a secure message to your friend with they public
key, they can decode it with themselves private key.

**Keep yourself and friend public key**. if your freind loose your public key, you can send him again.
If you lose your friend key, you can not provide any coded message and need to get your friend public key again.
If you lose your public key and someone need yours, you can not provide it again, So **Keep yourself and friend public key**
